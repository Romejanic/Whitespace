# Whitespace
A programming language composed entirely of whitespace.

Nope, I'm not kidding...

**NOTE:** I am aware that a language called Whitespace (created by [Edwin Brady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language))) with a similar concept exists already. I created this as a personal experiment and for fun, I'm not trying to copy the existing Whitespace language, and there are significant differences in syntax and how programs are actually written.

Whitespace is a programming language composed entirely of two characters; space and tab.

The number of spaces you type consecutively correspond to a value. The amount of tabs you type consecutively correspond to an action.

For a full guide of how to write a program in Whitespace, please view the specification.txt file.
An example "Hello world!" program is provided under helloworld.ws.

# To download Whitespace
1) Clone this repository (or download it).
2) CD into the directory of the repository.
2) Run the command "java -jar Whitespace.jar" followed by the name of your Whitespace file.

You can optionally run Whitespace in a debug mode which will print each step of the program and the value of the current address in memory.
To access this debug, run the program with the "--log-actions" flag before the file name.
